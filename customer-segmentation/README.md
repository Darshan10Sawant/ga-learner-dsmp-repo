### Project Overview

 Customer segmentation lies at the heart of every consumer facing business nowadays which involves being able to identify different types of customers and then figuring out ways to find more of those individuals so you canâ€¦ you guessed it, get more customers!

In this assessment, l be did exactly that, albeit with the help of K-Means clustering and observed how i can form groups of customers exhibiting similar behaviour.




### Learnings from the project

 I learned many things like Data Manipulation
                                               Dimensionality Reduction Technique with PCA
                                               KMeans clustering
                                              Interpreting clusters with visualization.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In dataset there was two sheet over there , joined both excel sheet base on common colunms ,before merging i created one more extra column in transactions sheet to know who was actual afected.then i joined both sheet 
after that i created pivot table to group by data and cleaned data that required for clustering algorithm. after that i applied k mean clustering algorithm to make cluster ,total 5 cluster i maked (given in glab theory)

 


### Challenges faced

 data cleaning was one of the big challege in ML. there has many columns which not important .
I simply maked pivot table to take insides of data and assigned each offer number(ID) as columns names ,and value in which took 1 as a make transactions base on index (Customer Last Name)
