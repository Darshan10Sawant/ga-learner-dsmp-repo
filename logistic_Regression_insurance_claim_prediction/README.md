### Project Overview

 In this project predicted the Insurance claim using logistic regression. dataset contains information on the insurance claim. each observation is different policyholder with various features like the age of the person, the gender of the policyholder, body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, number of children of the policyholder, smoking state of the policyholder and individual medical costs billed by health insurance.


### Learnings from the project

 After completed this project, i  have a better understanding of how to build a logistic regression model. In this project, i  applyed the following concepts.

Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Logistic Regression
Auc score
Roc AUC plot


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 i used cross-validation using grid search to predict good model.


### Challenges faced

 i think there no challege for this problem.if challege could be coming if target variable not balance(bias class)
